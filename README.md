# Simple Login/Register Demo

Run the app locally:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start server:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes:
- Users are stored in `User_data.txt` in the project folder (one user per line, fields separated by `|`).
- This is a demo — passwords are stored in plain text for simplicity. Do not use this approach in production.
